# Lid Driven Cavity Flow

The lid-driven cavity is a popular problem within the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for validating computational methods. In this repository, we will walk through the process of generating a 2D flow simulation for the Lid Driven Cavity (LDC) flow using Nvidia Modulus framework.

## Problem Description

The lid-driven cavity is a well-known benchmark problem for viscous incompressible fluid flow [75]. The geometry at stake is shown in Figure 27. We are dealing with a square cavity consisting of three rigid walls with no-slip conditions and a lid moving with a tangential x-direction velocity of 1m/s. The Reynolds number based on the cavity height is chosen be 10.
