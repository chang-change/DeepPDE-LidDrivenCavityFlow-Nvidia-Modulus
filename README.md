# Lid Driven Cavity Flow

The lid-driven cavity is a popular problem within the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for validating computational methods. In this repository, we will walk through the process of generating a 2D flow simulation for the Lid Driven Cavity (LDC) flow using Nvidia Modulus framework.
